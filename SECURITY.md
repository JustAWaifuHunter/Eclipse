## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out directly to any project team member on Discord when reporting a security vulnerability.

We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two for us to sync internally and determine the severity of the report and its impact. Please, do not use a public facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues.
